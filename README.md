## Hi there 👋

Welcome to the official GitHub page of BearlySleeping, an indie game team dedicated to pioneering the integration of artificial intelligence into the world of gaming. Our mission is to create immersive and dynamic experiences through the innovative use of AI technologies like ChatGPT, DALL·E, ElevenLabs, and more.
